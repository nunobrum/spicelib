class Simulator(ABC):
    """Pure static class template for Spice simulators. This class only defines the interface of the subclasses.
    The variables below shall be overridden by the subclasses. Instantiating this class will raise a SpiceSimulatorError
    exception.

    A typical subclass for a Windows installation is:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MySpiceWindowsInstallation(Simulator):
            spice_exe = ['<path to the spice executable>']
            process_name = "<name of the process on Windows Task Manager>"


    or on a Linux distribution:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MySpiceLinuxInstallation(Simulator):
            spice_exe = ['<wine_command>', '<path to the spice executable>']
            process_name = "<name of the process within the system>"


    If you use MacOS, you can choose either one of the 2 above. If you are on Intel, running LTSpice under wine (therefore: like under Linux) is preferred.


    The subclasses should then implement at least the run() function as a classmethod.
    
    .. code-block:: python

            cmd_run = cls.spice_exe + ['-Run'] + ['-b'] + [netlist_file] + cmd_line_switches
            return run_function(cmd_run, timeout=timeout, stdout=stdout, stderr=stderr, cwd=cwd)


    The ``run_function()`` can be imported from the simulator.py with
    ``from spicelib.sim.simulator import run_function`` instruction.
